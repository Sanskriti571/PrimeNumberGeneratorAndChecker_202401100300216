# PrimeNumberGeneratorAndChecker_202401100300216

A prime number generator and checker is a useful tool for identifying prime numbers and generating a list of them within a given range. . Prime numbers are natural numbers greater than 1 that can only be divided by 1 and themselves.
The provided Python program includes two key functions: is_prime(n), which checks if a number is prime, and generate_primes(limit), which generates a list of prime numbers up to a specified limit. By efficiently determining prime numbers, this program can assist in tasks such as number theory research, encryption algorithms, and mathematical problem-solving.

The methodology behind the prime number generator and checker involves two main functions: is_prime(n) and generate_primes(limit). 

1. Prime Number Checking (is_prime(n)):
   
o The function first checks if n is less than 2, as numbers less than 2 are not prime. 
o It then iterates from 2 to the square root of n, checking if n is divisible by any number in this range. 
o If n is divisible by any of these numbers, it returns False; otherwise, it returns True, confirming n is prime. 

2. Prime Number Generation (generate_primes(limit)):
   
o The function initializes an empty list primes to store prime numbers. 
o It iterates through numbers from 2 to the specified limit and checks each number using the is_prime(n) function. 
o If a number is prime, it is added to the list. 
o Finally, the function returns the list of all prime numbers up to limit.
